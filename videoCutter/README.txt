make a folder "video" - where the video to be cut is stored.
make a text file where the time stamps will be stored 
- also be cautiious that the end time of video is also needed as the very last timestamp.
after cutting, all videos will be stored in "video_out" folder.

make appropriate changes to the path if your video is at differnt path. 
comments are written to specify what each line is doing.
