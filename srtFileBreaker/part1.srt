1
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,846
that….·
2
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,046
What is it?
3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,450
(thunder)
4
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,561
I see it!! Get ready to jump!!
5
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,964
Onyankopon!! Come quickly too!!
6
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:33,901
Not yet!! Steer right above the founder!!
7
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,737
After that, I'll make an emergency landing!!・
8
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:40,040
So, make sure
to descend to your ancestors!! Understood...
9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,376
Onyankopon!!
Argh!!
10
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,279
Wow Aa!!
11
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,214
Tsk...!
12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,483
Don't hate it.
13
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,286
You beast bastard!!
14
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,655
Saved me the trouble of searching!!
15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,191
Attack target Beast Titan!!
16
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,094
Use all your power to destroy this!!
17
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,394
Stop the “earth rumbling”!!
18
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,701
Woooo!!
19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,543
Now!!
20
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,478
Uuuuu...!!
21
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,480
Damn...!!
22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,482
Ellen!!
23
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:37,765
・～
24
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,865
...ooooo!!
25
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,908
Wow!!
26
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,444
Shit!! I can’t get off!!
27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,248
...!! Huh!! Huh!!
28
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,551
Woooooooooo!!
29
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:09,163
・～
30
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,163
liner!!
31
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,873
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!
32
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:26,347
・～
33
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:30,751
(Marley soldier) To the armored giant... to the chariot giant...
34
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,388
That is a three-dimensional maneuvering device... No way...
35
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:38,959
Paradis Island forces are trying to stop the "earth rumbling"...
(people cheering)
36
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
liner!!
37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,101
Ellen...
38
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,437
Let me ask you the question again .
39
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,141
"Where is your freedom?"
40
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,341
After pulling it out of there...
41
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:19,600
・～
42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,271
(Sound of door creaking)
43
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:33,771
・～
44
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't think I'll be able to respond.・
45
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,488
If it's a hollow shell...
46
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:46,961
As expected... Sieg
hides his body in the same way as the "Warhammer Titan"...
47
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:53,067
So, out of this mountain of bones,
find a body measuring 1 meter long and 10 cm wide...
48
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,536
There's no way you can do that!!
49
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,739
So I have no choice but to give up!! Armin!!
50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,839
I know!!
(Jean)!
51
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,945
I'll blow this place away in 1 minute!!
52
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,145
Cooperate with the giant of car power and get away from here!!
53
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,785
Armin...
54
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:16,490
I can't imagine Eren, who was expecting my attack, to die from this!!
55
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,425
but…·
56
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,494
If I blow these bones apart...
57
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,094
We might be able to find out where Eren and Sieg are!
58
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,469
(Connie) Be careful, Armin!!
(Jean) If you think something is dangerous...
59
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,969
Don't care about us, just give it your all!
60
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,114
<For those who can't throw anything away...
61
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,850
You won't be able to change anything.・
62
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,450
I know...
if I don't throw it away, nothing will change.>
63
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,159
< I have to give up my naive hopes ...
64
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,259
Eren... I...>
65
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,401
Armin!!
Ah!!
66
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,401
Struggling!! Hmmmm!!
67
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,280
Armin
!!
68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh!!
69
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,901
Let's go... Seino!
70
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,270
(Boy) It's not moving...
71
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,505
(Doctor) He's breathing...
72
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,808
Looks like he hit his head.
73
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:44,211
Did this man also
come from Paradis Island?
...!
74
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,814
Hey! Can you hear me...
75
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,882
Do you know Annie Leonhart?
76
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,518
She's my daughter!!・
77
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,418
Hey, you!! Can't you hear me?
78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,325
It’s coming!! Reiner!!
79
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,061
Ooooooooo!!
80
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,661
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !!
81
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,067
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…!!
82
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,679
Oh! What the hell are these guys?
83
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:31,458
(Jan) He's not an innocent giant...
84
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,261
What should I do? I'll run out of thunder spears soon.
85
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,164
I mean, is Armin still alive?
86
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:41,034
If he had even the slightest scratch,
he would have instantly turned into a giant...
87
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,905
In other words, it was captured without a scratch.・
88
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,143
But he was taken away by Eren's ass.
89
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,045
Being forced to pass by countless giants...
90
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:56,750
Even if I was in perfect condition , I wouldn't choose to attack there .
91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,686
So calm down.
92
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,856
Hmm...!!
Mikasa, don't hurry.
93
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,460
Until I become a decoy and attract a group of enemies.
94
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,096
That's impossible, Corporal.
95
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,866
I found out the identity of the enemy... That's...
96
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,702
The ``Nine Giants'' of all time.・
97
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:19,273
I don't know if the successors still have any consciousness left,
but...
98
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:25,412
With the power of the Founding Titan, I'm sure it can be revived inexhaustibly ...
99
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:30,284
A veteran giant soldier created solely for the purpose of fighting .
100
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,187
There's no way we can fight against each other...
101
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:37,090
(Peak)
Yes, that's why I can't say anything leisurely.
102
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,594
I'm not really friends with Eren.
103
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,564
Eh
(Jean) Oh no way... Peak!!
104
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,564
Ha!!
That bastard...!
105
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,750
No matter how you think about it, this is the first place to shoot!!
106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,350
My aim has been one from the beginning!!
107
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,824
hang on!!
108
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,024
Disappear!! Nightmare!!
109
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,803
Uh...｡
110
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,511
Peak!!
111
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,248
Gaaa...!! Gaaa!!
112
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,183
(Liner) Galliard
113
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,151
(Jean) This is Liner!!
114
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,251
Stop that movement!!
115
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,590
Argh!!
116
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,398
Corporal!!
Cuckoo...
117
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,601
Hurry up and get Armin
back!!
118
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,937
There is no other
way out!!
119
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,840
Otherwise, we'll all die here!!
120
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,775
Gaaaaa!!
121
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:06,113
(Marley soldier) Attack on Titan and Paradis Island forces
are at war...
122
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,983
The enemy body's path and speed remain unchanged,
heading towards us!
123
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,487
I can't just sit back and watch.
124
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,057
All members! Attack the enemy with a cannon!
Ha!!
125
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,461
but…! Most of the soldiers
were assigned to airship units.
126
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:25,332
There are only about three cannons that can be operated with the remaining soldiers ...
127
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:29,202
Is that
a reason to remain silent?
128
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,138
(Marley soldier)!
129
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:36,677
(Muller) Those people who still fight desperately on the enemy's giant back ...
130
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,913
What exactly are you fighting for?
131
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,913
Let’s go, Reiner!!
Guaaaa!!
132
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,487
Tee!!
133
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,823
Grrrr!!
134
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,823
Damn...!!
135
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Raaaa!!
136
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,503
Uuuuuuuuuuuuck!!
137
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,439
hurry up!!
138
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,739
Guaaaaaaa!!
139
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,180
Mikasa!!
140
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,396
<It was sweet...
141
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,132
Consciousness...
142
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,736
Are you trying to suffocate me like this...?
143
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:40,474
Eren... me...
144
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,410
No... it's that kid...
145
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,879
Founder Ymir.・
146
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,151
As Eren says,
if Eren just keeps going...
147
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,021
This resistance is the will of the founder Ymir...
148
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,392
If that's the case... Founder Ymir too...
149
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:02,562
Desires the genocide of humanity...
150
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:06,400
Founder Ymir... Invincible...
151
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,803
there is nothing to do….·
152
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,673
Like this... By the way...
153
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,673
Will it end... >
154
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,413
...!
155
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,160
...Bertholdt!!
156
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,539
Gooooooo!! Woooooo...!!
157
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,839
(Connie Mikasa) Liner
(Jan) Liner!!
158
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,857
Oi… no way…｡
159
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,857
Tsk!!
160
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:29,416
Huh… huh… huh…｡
161
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,118
Ha…ha…｡
162
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,118
Uuuuu!!
163
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,056
Wake up Connie!! Corporal!!
164
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,862
...Goff.
165
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,370
Sorry...
it looks like the three-dimensional maneuvering device has been damaged...
166
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,241
Me too... the handle on the right is crazy...
167
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,276
I can't pull it up...
168
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,411
Jean!! Take your hands off me!!
169
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,847
I can turn into a giant once more!!
170
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:06,286
So?
Will his armor be trampled by the rumbling of the earth ?
171
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,686
Despite its name, Teme's giant
is often broken!
172
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,729
(Liner) Still... Do you think you can win?
173
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:21,501
(Jan) No, but at least
let's struggle until we die.
174
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,805
We're the Survey Corps on the brink of death.
175
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,708
Oh...!
176
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,710
Jean...
177
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,810
Oh...!!
178
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,486
Ha...!!
179
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,855
Connie!!
180
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,855
Good...!!
181
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,594
Ugh...!!
182
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,729
Tee!!
183
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,729
!! Corporal!!
184
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,969
Woo!! Ha...!
185
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,250
...Cuckoo!!
186
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,252
come!!
187
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,121
I am strong!! Because!!
188
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,290
How much will it cost?
189
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,926
(Ani) Mikasa, you're a bit of a nuisance!!
Huh...
190
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,861
(Ani) Hold on!!
191
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:45,018
・～
192
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:50,824
No...I never
thought it would actually fly either...
193
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:55,524
It really flies...
so I had no choice but to go...
194
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,231
But I'm glad I came.
195
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:07,004
(Refugee) It's a bird... It's carrying people!
196
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,144
(Rainer) Why did you even come, Gabi?
197
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,813
(Gabi) It's because Reiner left us behind.
198
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,749
Even I can fight!!
199
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,485
Ani・
200
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,920
The Azumabit ship sank.
201
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,856
picture·
202
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:26,726
(Ani)
I couldn't stand Falco's transformation into a giant.・
203
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,262
Even though I have no proof that I can fly...
204
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,532
Kiyomi agreed to everything and let him go.
205
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:37,404
That's why we have to stop the rumbling!!
We have to respond to our thoughts!!
206
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,706
Gabi...
207
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:43,410
So aluminum...
or what about the peak?
208
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,146
Armin is captured by a giant and his life is in danger!
209
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:50,050
Oh!
The giant that captured Armin
should be near his tailbone.
210
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,919
Ani, lend me your strength!!
211
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,190
Your childhood friend
is being held prisoner...
212
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,125
Of course I'll get it back.
213
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,529
(Gabi) Mr. Peek
is the one with the (Liner) skull.
214
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,466
I tried to blow up the nape of the neck, but
I was blocked by the War Hammer Titan...
215
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,170
(Gabi) Explosion and
(Levi) both at the same time... Damn...
216
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,238
Commander・
217
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,008
Meanwhile, rescue Armin...
218
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,378
It relies on super-large explosions.
219
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,148
With the other hand,
aim at Eren and attack the nape of his neck.
220
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,785
We will divide into two groups and do it at the same time.・
221
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:30,590
There's no more time to worry about Eren
...
222
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,290
No... that kind of thing didn't exist from the beginning.
223
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,864
Commander…｡
224
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,899
But…｡
(Connie) But what is it?
225
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,599
If it hadn't been for a miracle like Falco flying,
we would have died there...
226
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,443
Ah... I can't accomplish anything...
Jean...
227
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,213
Um... what I want to say to an idiot is...
228
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,015
There was a lot of trouble, but... Shit!
229
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,320
I
don't want to give up on Eren either!! But!
230
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,223
Corporal can't fight anymore because of me!!
231
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,126
Even though the opponent is the Founding Titan!!・
232
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,926
What can you do if you cut back?
233
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,337
Mikasa...
234
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,272
Eren...
235
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,172
Let's kill Eren ...
236
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,347
(Ani) Mikasa...
Mikasa...
237
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:31,047
Mikasa!! You
should only think about saving Armin!!
238
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,291
You don't have to think about anything else
...
239
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,291
…Yeah.
240
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,529
(Marley soldiers) Oh...!
241
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,673
(Artillery) Oh!
242
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,576
Let's head towards Attack on Titan again!!
243
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,776
We'll do it too!!
One gate or two gates is better than nothing!!
244
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,219
Are you a refugee?
245
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,655
No, wait! ・
246
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:12,258
A faded armband mark on my left arm...!
247
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,258
It's Eldian!!
248
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,898
Oi! Wait please!!
249
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,568
I just came to ask you to treat the injured!!
250
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,305
This is far from that!
What is the real purpose?
251
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,974
Oh!
Mr. Leonhart That's why I said it!
252
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,043
I can't believe what I expect from Marleyans...!
253
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:34,214
(Eldians) Looks like we have more people here!
He also has the best experience in combat!
254
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:38,084
They have been sent to the front lines many times for the sake of the Marleyans !!
255
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,587
Oh...!
256
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,989
Put down your guns, Eldians
!!
257
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,924
(Eldians) Ugh...!!
(Leonhart) Come on!!
258
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,727
(Driver) I'm telling you to put down the gun!!
259
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,197
(Leonhart) Driver, before you know it...
260
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,700
Uh… ugh…!!
261
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,702
Ah...!
262
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,802
Damn...!
263
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,341
Director Mueller!!
264
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,284
Oh!
265
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,758
(gunshot)
266
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:23,229
What?
They're killing each other at a time like this!
267
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,529
Falco!! Be careful of flying objects!!
268
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh!
269
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,105
(Liner) It’s coming!!
270
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,281
Uuuuuuuuuu!!
271
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,422
Jean!! Reiner!!
Please don't die!!
272
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,731
Ah...
you guys too...
273
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:02,131
I will attract the Warhammer Titan!!
274
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,337
(Liner)
<Peak... Please hold out somehow...>
275
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,246
Guuuuuu!! Gaaaa!!
276
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,946
Guaaaaaaaa!!
277
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,024
Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!
278
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,024
Guaah!!
279
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,328
Now!! Jean!!
(Jean) Ugh!!
280
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,970
Uuuuuuu!!
281
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,306
Be patient!! Reiner!!・
282
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,606
Until I detonate it...
283
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,744
Damn...!
That's normal, it increases me...!
284
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,120
(Peak) Heeeeeeee!!
285
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,720
I wish I could do three-dimensional maneuvers too...!
286
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,096
Shit, don't come closer... Gah!! Ugh!!
287
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,169
...Peak!! No!! Run away!!
288
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,413
Jean... I'm
not cut out for battle.
289
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,383
I thought it was a giant working on chores ...
290
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,483
It's a mistake!!
291
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,556
(Peak)
As long as I don't get killed, the sustaining power of the car is...
292
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,656
I can fight until I win!!
293
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,364
Even hundreds of times!!
294
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,664
That's why Jean!! Don't worry about me and
detonate!!
295
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,770
Argh!!
296
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,114
Well, even if I win a hundred times...
297
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,585
If there are a million enemies, there's nothing you can do...
298
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,455
Goaaaaaa!!
299
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,457
Gooooo!!
300
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,726
Ha ha ha ha...!
301
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,029
(Ani) Even Bertolt is a puppet...
302
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,532
can not forgive…!
303
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,467
…there was!!
304
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,370
that! A pig or some kind of giant!!
305
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,940
Which/
that! Over there... that!
306
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,410
(Ani)
Where? What are the nine giants?
307
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,115
Is it a Kuruma force? A beast? It might be a jaw!!
(Ani)...I don't know!!
308
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:32,351
Mikasa!! You're being serious!!
You're doing it!!
309
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,855
Ah!! Only one escaped!!
310
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,559
(Ani) That... That's an okapi!!
I don't know about okapi!!
311
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,762
(Ani) Go Falco!!
Chase that okapi or something to the tailbone.
312
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,862
Bring back Armin!!
313
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,272
I can support you with this rifle!
314
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,772
There are no giants here who would die because of it.
315
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,980
(Levi)
<Where is Sieg? Where is he?
316
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,650
Damn... Even if I find it,
it's still this crap.
317
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,750
It's a hindrance... Shit...!!>
318
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,228
<I have never failed to follow his orders
...not even once...
319
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,928
But... why is his last command the only one...>
320
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:28,774
<Our role
may have ended there...
321
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:33,974
If the role was just to deliver the kids to the sea ...>
322
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:43,182
<Hey... Were the hearts you sacrificed meant to crush other hearts? >
323
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,094
<No...
324
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,997
The world without giants that we dreamed of...
325
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:55,835
It must have been a shockingly auspicious
ideal world.・
326
00:23:55,835 --> 00:24:01,440
Otherwise,
it's not worth their hearts.・
327
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,677
Erwin I...
328
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:08,677
I have no regrets about not choosing you.>
329
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,889
< I entrusted my future to that guy who had the same eyes as you ...>
330
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:24,330
・～
331
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,930
Tae!! Connie! I went there!!
332
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,837
Wait, Oi!!
333
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,845
It’s gone!! You can run towards the skull!!
334
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,845
Ani!!
335
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:46,216
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!!
336
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,694
Oh!!
337
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,694
Stop, Okapi!!
338
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,734
Ha...!
339
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,734
Aaah!!
340
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,144
Ugh...!
341
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,880
...
342
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,080
Aaaaaa!!
343
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,456
Uuuuuuu!!
344
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,456
Ani!!
345
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,996
It's no good if you're alone!!
You'll be killed right away!!
346
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,670
For those with super large okapi...!!
347
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,672
Unpalatable…!
348
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,672
…Oi!!
349
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,962
Why...
why isn't my body moving...
350
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,264
Please move!
351
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,800
Everyone will die!
352
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,770
Liner...Peak...
353
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,040
Jean... Connie...
354
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,210
Mikasa... Ani.
355
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,081
Everyone is going to die!!
Wake up, you scum!!
356
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,718
Bastard!! Useless!!
357
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,621
Ugh... huh...
358
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:33,292
I hate myself! Zuuutt you!!
359
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,696
You have been betraying me!!
360
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:40,166
The life I received!! The expectations!! The responsibility too!!
361
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,937
Nothing!! Nothing!!
You couldn't give anything back!!
362
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,274
But!! Why is he dead?
363
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,474
Move!! Move!!
364
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:59,352
Aaaaaaa…!!
365
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,152
Aaaaaaa...!!
366
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:11,897
(People scream)
367
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:55,574
・～
368
00:27:55,574 --> 00:28:24,537
(cry)
369
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:33,179
・～
370
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,114
teeth….
371
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:45,591
・～
372
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,260
<Sand…｡・
373
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,831
Think about it...
if you're really dead...
374
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:56,431
How can you think without oxygen flowing to your brain ? >
375
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:03,705
<This is
not a dream, a vision, or an afterlife.>
376
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,981
<This is the “road”…
377
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,881
This is... reality!!>
378
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:23,796
<I'm supposed to be in the giant's mouth, so
why do I know everyone's situation...? ・
379
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:28,968
Is it because all Eldians
are connected through "roads"? ・
380
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:34,139
Then
maybe we can do something here...>
381
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,576
Yes, think about it...
382
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,576
Think!!
383
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,482
picture….
384
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,624
(Armin's footsteps)
385
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,828
Hello,
Mr. Zeke.
386
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:11,176
Hello,
Ellen's friend.
387
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,076
Were you also
eaten by Ymir?
388
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:30,129
(Jeek) A long time ago...
389
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:35,329
When only matter existed in this world ...
390
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:44,777
(Jeek) Something imaginable and intangible
repeatedly appears and disappears.
391
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:48,877
Eventually, something survived.
392
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,650
It's called "life."
393
00:30:57,256 --> 00:31:00,893
The reason why life remained in the end was...
394
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:05,731
This is because life
has the property of ``multiplying. ''
395
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:10,302
In order to increase, life changes its shape.
396
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:16,108
We have adapted to any environment and
have become what we are today.
397
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,946
More, wider, richer...
398
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:25,884
In other words, the purpose of life is to "increase."
399
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:32,091
This sand, stones, and water
are not going to increase.
400
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:36,929
However, life is still desperately trying to increase.
401
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:42,735
After all, death and species extinction go against the purpose of increasing numbers.
402
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,438
For that reason, there is a penalty called fear.
403
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:52,044
That child
was also desperately trying to escape from that pain...
404
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:56,882
Create a stronger, larger, and immortal body.
405
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,252
And to a world where even death doesn't exist...
406
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,655
She escaped...
407
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:08,460
That's the founder Ymir...
this is the "world where death doesn't exist"...
408
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,233
If that's the case,
what exactly is Ymir's purpose?
409
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,170
I also spend a lot of time here ...
410
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,073
I tried to understand her .
411
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,443
Even though I have this much power ...
412
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,380
I couldn't go against King Fritz
...
413
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,217
Stayed here for 2000 years
414
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:35,117
The reason I continued to follow King Fritz.
415
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,562
I'm sure I left something to be desired,
but...
416
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:49,368
Eren understood that, but
I couldn't...
417
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:54,073
That's why Ymir
joined Eren.
418
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:58,944
Please tell me
how to return to the outside world from here.
419
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,849
Well... I don't think it's possible anymore...
420
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,649
I'm not giving up on anything.
421
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,357
Why...
eh... That's...
422
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,827
Is it because it will still increase?
423
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:20,132
Is it really that important to you to keep the species alive ?
424
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,835
What's happening now...
425
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,805
This can be described as a tragic state of life ruled by fear .
426
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:31,143
brought about by completely meaningless
life activities.
427
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,913
Don't be afraid...
my friends are fighting!!
428
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:39,184
Because now we can still save many people
from fear...!!
429
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,553
I am fighting fear!!
430
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,090
Why can't I lose...?
431
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,827
Being alive means
you'll die someday, right?
432
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,827
Hmm…｡
433
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:58,470
Maybe I'll feel relieved before it's all over ...
434
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,874
I don't even know what it means...
435
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:06,512
After the days of being forced to dance just to increase ...
436
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:09,812
Now I'm free...
437
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,719
ah….
438
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,897
It was dusk, facing a tree on the hill...
439
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,797
The three of us raced...
440
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,471
Eren, who had just
started talking, suddenly started running...
441
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,941
Mikasa dared to run behind Eren...
442
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,243
I'm the dobe after all...
443
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:45,551
But... that day, the wind was warm and
it felt good just running...
444
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:48,587
There were a lot of dry leaves.
445
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:53,292
At that time, for some reason, I thought...
446
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:59,092
I think the three of us were born to play here together ...
447
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,705
Even when I'm reading a book at home on a rainy day...
448
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:10,576
Even when the squirrel ate the fruit I gave it...
449
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:15,347
That's what I thought when we all walked through the market...
450
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,785
I feel like this ordinary moment is so important...
451
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,688
it is…?
Hmm…｡
452
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,591
This one was buried in sand...
453
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,393
Why is that...
454
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,264
Now... But for me, this is...
455
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:36,034
It's not necessary or anything to increase
...
456
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:39,234
It's something very
important.
457
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,843
Ah... that's right.
458
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,746
Just throw it and catch it...
459
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:51,846
Throw it again. Just repeat it.
460
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:01,894
It doesn't make any sense...but it's true...
461
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:06,894
I
was happy just playing catch the whole time.
462
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,568

463
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,180

Gah...!
465
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,785
If my arm heals,
I can still fight...!
466
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,585
It's the limit!! Back up to the bottom of the liner!
467
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,926

Liner!!

Ugh... ugh...! ・

00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:23,508
Did you help me...
B...Bertholdt...
480
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,211
I don't know...but...
481
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,511
Don't miss this opportunity!!
482
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,420
I got it!!
483
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,029
Armin!!
484
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,629
Give it back!!!

Armin!!
Damn!!

Oooooooooooooooo!!

Ugh!!

00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,769
Sorry everyone...
495
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,072
But... it's okay now.
496
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,007

(Gabi) What do you mean?
A giant is helping you?
500
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,459
It seems so.
501
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,195
(Jeek) Ooi!!
502
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,531
Ooooo!!

Here it is!!
504
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,737
Eh...
that's stupid...
505
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:02,541
You wanted to meet me, right? Levi!!
506
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,510
I didn't want to meet you though!!
507
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,346
...Sieg.

(Connie) What's going on? This is...
510
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:20,459
It's all thanks to Sieg.
Sieg...
511
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:26,331
It awakened everyone who had been sleeping in the world of the road, where there is no life or death .
512
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:30,702
All Eldians
are connected by "roads".
513
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,737
That's probably...
514
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:37,175
This is because Founder Ymir
is seeking a connection.
515
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,778
Asking us something...
516
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,147
...!
517
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,447
Bertolt...
518
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:53,992
Kusava-san,
our wishes didn't come true...
519
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:59,164
I still think that the euthanasia plan was not a mistake...
520
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:03,502
But
if it's just to play catch with you...
521
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,302
I wonder if I can be born again...
522
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,610
that's why…·
523
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,310
I'd like to thank you, Dad.
524
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,719
I
took everything from you.
525
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:26,191
Life, power, and precious memories...
526
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,860
That's why I understand.
527
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,795
I can't stay still here .
528
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,731
everyone….
529
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:35,433

00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,948
I wish I had thought of that sooner...
533
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,883
Well...
534
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:56,283
The bugs are too good to kill so many of them
...
535
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,946
The rumbling... has stopped...

00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Oh!!
541
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,660
this…!!
542
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,498
Hurrying to death... you stupid idiot!!
543
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,734
(explosion sound)
544
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,734
Argh!!
545
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,275
Grrrr…!!!!
546
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,851
This guy!! On Eren’s neck again!!
547
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:41,359
Uuuuuuuuuuuuck!!
548
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,295
Liner!!
(Connie) Jean!! Peak!!・
549
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:46,865
Hurry and leave!!
Armin will blow away every bone!!
550
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,200
Wait!! Liner!!
551
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,539
(Peak) If it's an armored giant,
I'm sure it can withstand a super-sized explosion.
552
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:59,511
Above all, letting this opportunity pass
would mean ruining Reiner's resolve.
553
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,611
Nuaaaaaaaa!!!
554
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,050
thank you….
555
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,990
Without everyone's help...
556
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,490
I couldn't stop the rumbling...
557
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,404
Goodbye...
Eren.
558
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:43,804
(explosion sound)
559
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:55,367
Ugh...
(Gabi's father) Sister!! Are you okay?
560
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:58,770
What on earth...
561
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:02,070
・It was a huge explosion!!
・Did everyone survive?
(Father Falco)! that…!
562
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,980
(Jean) Look at the bones...!!・
563
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,580
Is Eren... dead?
564
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:18,823
Ugh!!
Ackerman awakens to his power...
565
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,760
Apparently , sudden headaches were
common...
566
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,230
I've been a slave who just follows orders...
ever since I was a kid...
<I can't believe that was the last time...>
567
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,634
Mikasa, I hated you.
568
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,734
<That kind of thing...>
569
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,075
Oh!
570
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:39,075
Oh...!!
571
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:50,588
・～
572
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:54,159
(Connie) That doesn't mean I don't have any regrets.・
573
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,094
but…·
574
00:44:56,094 --> 00:45:01,366
We weren't wrong.
We stopped the rumbling...
575
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:05,537
How... from the containment area to here...
576
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:10,141
(Carina) Leonhart-
san led everyone to this point.
577
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,341
Let me go.
578
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,579
…Ha!
579
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,918
Armin!!
Where is Liner?
580
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,298
(Gabi) Reiner!!
(Jan) You're safe!!
581
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,598
Oi!! Look!! Over there!!
582
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:41,272
Are you still alive after that explosion?
583
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,842
Yes... what on earth is that?
584
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,377
Well...just...
585
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:49,377
It certainly shouldn't be kept alive.
586
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,820
(Explosion sound)
(Aluminum liner)!!
587
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,723
(explosion sound)
588
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:01,626
Well... I guess...
589
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,629
I don't think you'll die from that.
590
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,929
Ah...but what should I do?
591
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,234
...Eren.
(Earth rumbling)
