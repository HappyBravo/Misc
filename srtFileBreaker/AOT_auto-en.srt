1
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,846
that….·

2
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,046
What is it?

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,450
(thunder)

4
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,561
I see it!! Get ready to jump!!

5
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,964
Onyankopon!! Come quickly too!!

6
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:33,901
Not yet!! Steer right above the founder!!

7
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,737
After that, I'll make an emergency landing!!・

8
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:40,040
So, make sure
to descend to your ancestors!! Understood...

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,376
Onyankopon!!
Argh!!

10
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,279
Wow Aa!!

11
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,214
Tsk...!

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,483
Don't hate it.

13
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,286
You beast bastard!!

14
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,655
Saved me the trouble of searching!!

15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,191
Attack target Beast Titan!!

16
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,094
Use all your power to destroy this!!

17
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,394
Stop the “earth rumbling”!!

18
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,701
Woooo!!

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,543
Now!!

20
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,478
Uuuuu...!!

21
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,480
Damn...!!

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,482
Ellen!!

23
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:37,765
・～

24
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,865
...ooooo!!

25
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,908
Wow!!

26
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,444
Shit!! I can’t get off!!

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,248
...!! Huh!! Huh!!

28
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,551
Woooooooooo!!

29
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:09,163
・～

30
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,163
liner!!

31
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,873
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!

32
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:26,347
・～

33
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:30,751
(Marley soldier) To the armored giant... to the chariot giant...

34
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,388
That is a three-dimensional maneuvering device... No way...

35
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:38,959
Paradis Island forces are trying to stop the "earth rumbling"...
(people cheering)

36
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
liner!!

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,101
Ellen...

38
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,437
Let me ask you the question again .

39
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,141
"Where is your freedom?"

40
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,341
After pulling it out of there...

41
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:19,600
・～

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,271
(Sound of door creaking)

43
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:33,771
・～

44
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't think I'll be able to respond.・

45
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,488
If it's a hollow shell...

46
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:46,961
As expected... Sieg
hides his body in the same way as the "Warhammer Titan"...

47
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:53,067
So, out of this mountain of bones,
find a body measuring 1 meter long and 10 cm wide...

48
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,536
There's no way you can do that!!

49
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,739
So I have no choice but to give up!! Armin!!

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,839
I know!!
(Jean)!

51
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,945
I'll blow this place away in 1 minute!!

52
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,145
Cooperate with the giant of car power and get away from here!!

53
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,785
Armin...

54
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:16,490
I can't imagine Eren, who was expecting my attack, to die from this!!

55
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,425
but…·

56
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,494
If I blow these bones apart...

57
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,094
We might be able to find out where Eren and Sieg are!

58
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,469
(Connie) Be careful, Armin!!
(Jean) If you think something is dangerous...

59
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,969
Don't care about us, just give it your all!

60
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,114
<For those who can't throw anything away...

61
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,850
You won't be able to change anything.・

62
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,450
I know...
if I don't throw it away, nothing will change.>

63
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,159
< I have to give up my naive hopes ...

64
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,259
Eren... I...>

65
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,401
Armin!!
Ah!!

66
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,401
Struggling!! Hmmmm!!

67
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,280
Armin
!!

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh!!

69
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,901
Let's go... Seino!

70
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,270
(Boy) It's not moving...

71
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,505
(Doctor) He's breathing...

72
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,808
Looks like he hit his head.

73
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:44,211
Did this man also
come from Paradis Island?
...!

74
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,814
Hey! Can you hear me...

75
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,882
Do you know Annie Leonhart?

76
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,518
She's my daughter!!・

77
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,418
Hey, you!! Can't you hear me?

78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,325
It’s coming!! Reiner!!

79
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,061
Ooooooooo!!

80
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,661
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !!

81
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,067
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…!!

82
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,679
Oh! What the hell are these guys?

83
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:31,458
(Jan) He's not an innocent giant...

84
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,261
What should I do? I'll run out of thunder spears soon.

85
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,164
I mean, is Armin still alive?

86
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:41,034
If he had even the slightest scratch,
he would have instantly turned into a giant...

87
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,905
In other words, it was captured without a scratch.・

88
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,143
But he was taken away by Eren's ass.

89
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,045
Being forced to pass by countless giants...

90
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:56,750
Even if I was in perfect condition , I wouldn't choose to attack there .

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,686
So calm down.

92
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,856
Hmm...!!
Mikasa, don't hurry.

93
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,460
Until I become a decoy and attract a group of enemies.

94
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,096
That's impossible, Corporal.

95
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,866
I found out the identity of the enemy... That's...

96
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,702
The ``Nine Giants'' of all time.・

97
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:19,273
I don't know if the successors still have any consciousness left,
but...

98
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:25,412
With the power of the Founding Titan, I'm sure it can be revived inexhaustibly ...

99
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:30,284
A veteran giant soldier created solely for the purpose of fighting .

100
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,187
There's no way we can fight against each other...

101
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:37,090
(Peak)
Yes, that's why I can't say anything leisurely.

102
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,594
I'm not really friends with Eren.

103
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,564
Eh
(Jean) Oh no way... Peak!!

104
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,564
Ha!!
That bastard...!

105
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,750
No matter how you think about it, this is the first place to shoot!!

106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,350
My aim has been one from the beginning!!

107
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,824
hang on!!

108
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,024
Disappear!! Nightmare!!

109
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,803
Uh...｡

110
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,511
Peak!!

111
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,248
Gaaa...!! Gaaa!!

112
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,183
(Liner) Galliard

113
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,151
(Jean) This is Liner!!

114
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,251
Stop that movement!!

115
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,590
Argh!!

116
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,398
Corporal!!
Cuckoo...

117
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,601
Hurry up and get Armin
back!!

118
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,937
There is no other
way out!!

119
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,840
Otherwise, we'll all die here!!

120
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,775
Gaaaaa!!

121
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:06,113
(Marley soldier) Attack on Titan and Paradis Island forces
are at war...

122
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,983
The enemy body's path and speed remain unchanged,
heading towards us!

123
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,487
I can't just sit back and watch.

124
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,057
All members! Attack the enemy with a cannon!
Ha!!

125
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,461
but…! Most of the soldiers
were assigned to airship units.

126
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:25,332
There are only about three cannons that can be operated with the remaining soldiers ...

127
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:29,202
Is that
a reason to remain silent?

128
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,138
(Marley soldier)!

129
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:36,677
(Muller) Those people who still fight desperately on the enemy's giant back ...

130
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,913
What exactly are you fighting for?

131
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,913
Let’s go, Reiner!!
Guaaaa!!

132
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,487
Tee!!

133
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,823
Grrrr!!

134
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,823
Damn...!!

135
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Raaaa!!

136
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,503
Uuuuuuuuuuuuck!!

137
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,439
hurry up!!

138
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,739
Guaaaaaaa!!

139
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,180
Mikasa!!

140
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,396
<It was sweet...

141
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,132
Consciousness...

142
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,736
Are you trying to suffocate me like this...?

143
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:40,474
Eren... me...

144
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,410
No... it's that kid...

145
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,879
Founder Ymir.・

146
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,151
As Eren says,
if Eren just keeps going...

147
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,021
This resistance is the will of the founder Ymir...

148
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,392
If that's the case... Founder Ymir too...

149
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:02,562
Desires the genocide of humanity...

150
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:06,400
Founder Ymir... Invincible...

151
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,803
there is nothing to do….·

152
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,673
Like this... By the way...

153
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,673
Will it end... >

154
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,413
...!

155
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,160
...Bertholdt!!

156
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,539
Gooooooo!! Woooooo...!!

157
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,839
(Connie Mikasa) Liner
(Jan) Liner!!

158
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,857
Oi… no way…｡

159
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,857
Tsk!!

160
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:29,416
Huh… huh… huh…｡

161
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,118
Ha…ha…｡

162
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,118
Uuuuu!!

163
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,056
Wake up Connie!! Corporal!!

164
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,862
...Goff.

165
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,370
Sorry...
it looks like the three-dimensional maneuvering device has been damaged...

166
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,241
Me too... the handle on the right is crazy...

167
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,276
I can't pull it up...

168
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,411
Jean!! Take your hands off me!!

169
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,847
I can turn into a giant once more!!

170
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:06,286
So?
Will his armor be trampled by the rumbling of the earth ?

171
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,686
Despite its name, Teme's giant
is often broken!

172
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,729
(Liner) Still... Do you think you can win?

173
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:21,501
(Jan) No, but at least
let's struggle until we die.

174
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,805
We're the Survey Corps on the brink of death.

175
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,708
Oh...!

176
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,710
Jean...

177
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,810
Oh...!!

178
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,486
Ha...!!

179
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,855
Connie!!

180
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,855
Good...!!

181
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,594
Ugh...!!

182
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,729
Tee!!

183
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,729
!! Corporal!!

184
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,969
Woo!! Ha...!

185
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,250
...Cuckoo!!

186
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,252
come!!

187
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,121
I am strong!! Because!!

188
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,290
How much will it cost?

189
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,926
(Ani) Mikasa, you're a bit of a nuisance!!
Huh...

190
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,861
(Ani) Hold on!!

191
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:45,018
・～

192
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:50,824
No...I never
thought it would actually fly either...

193
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:55,524
It really flies...
so I had no choice but to go...

194
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,231
But I'm glad I came.

195
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:07,004
(Refugee) It's a bird... It's carrying people!

196
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,144
(Rainer) Why did you even come, Gabi?

197
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,813
(Gabi) It's because Reiner left us behind.

198
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,749
Even I can fight!!

199
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,485
Ani・

200
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,920
The Azumabit ship sank.

201
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,856
picture·

202
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:26,726
(Ani)
I couldn't stand Falco's transformation into a giant.・

203
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,262
Even though I have no proof that I can fly...

204
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,532
Kiyomi agreed to everything and let him go.

205
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:37,404
That's why we have to stop the rumbling!!
We have to respond to our thoughts!!

206
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,706
Gabi...

207
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:43,410
So aluminum...
or what about the peak?

208
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,146
Armin is captured by a giant and his life is in danger!

209
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:50,050
Oh!
The giant that captured Armin
should be near his tailbone.

210
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,919
Ani, lend me your strength!!

211
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,190
Your childhood friend
is being held prisoner...

212
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,125
Of course I'll get it back.

213
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,529
(Gabi) Mr. Peek
is the one with the (Liner) skull.

214
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,466
I tried to blow up the nape of the neck, but
I was blocked by the War Hammer Titan...

215
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,170
(Gabi) Explosion and
(Levi) both at the same time... Damn...

216
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,238
Commander・

217
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,008
Meanwhile, rescue Armin...

218
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,378
It relies on super-large explosions.

219
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,148
With the other hand,
aim at Eren and attack the nape of his neck.

220
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,785
We will divide into two groups and do it at the same time.・

221
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:30,590
There's no more time to worry about Eren
...

222
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,290
No... that kind of thing didn't exist from the beginning.

223
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,864
Commander…｡

224
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,899
But…｡
(Connie) But what is it?

225
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,599
If it hadn't been for a miracle like Falco flying,
we would have died there...

226
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,443
Ah... I can't accomplish anything...
Jean...

227
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,213
Um... what I want to say to an idiot is...

228
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,015
There was a lot of trouble, but... Shit!

229
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,320
I
don't want to give up on Eren either!! But!

230
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,223
Corporal can't fight anymore because of me!!

231
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,126
Even though the opponent is the Founding Titan!!・

232
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,926
What can you do if you cut back?

233
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,337
Mikasa...

234
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,272
Eren...

235
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,172
Let's kill Eren ...

236
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,347
(Ani) Mikasa...
Mikasa...

237
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:31,047
Mikasa!! You
should only think about saving Armin!!

238
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,291
You don't have to think about anything else
...

239
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,291
…Yeah.

240
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,529
(Marley soldiers) Oh...!

241
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,673
(Artillery) Oh!

242
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,576
Let's head towards Attack on Titan again!!

243
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,776
We'll do it too!!
One gate or two gates is better than nothing!!

244
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,219
Are you a refugee?

245
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,655
No, wait! ・

246
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:12,258
A faded armband mark on my left arm...!

247
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,258
It's Eldian!!

248
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,898
Oi! Wait please!!

249
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,568
I just came to ask you to treat the injured!!

250
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,305
This is far from that!
What is the real purpose?

251
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,974
Oh!
Mr. Leonhart That's why I said it!

252
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,043
I can't believe what I expect from Marleyans...!

253
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:34,214
(Eldians) Looks like we have more people here!
He also has the best experience in combat!

254
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:38,084
They have been sent to the front lines many times for the sake of the Marleyans !!

255
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,587
Oh...!

256
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,989
Put down your guns, Eldians
!!

257
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,924
(Eldians) Ugh...!!
(Leonhart) Come on!!

258
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,727
(Driver) I'm telling you to put down the gun!!

259
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,197
(Leonhart) Driver, before you know it...

260
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,700
Uh… ugh…!!

261
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,702
Ah...!

262
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,802
Damn...!

263
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,341
Director Mueller!!

264
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,284
Oh!

265
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,758
(gunshot)

266
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:23,229
What?
They're killing each other at a time like this!

267
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,529
Falco!! Be careful of flying objects!!

268
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh!

269
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,105
(Liner) It’s coming!!

270
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,281
Uuuuuuuuuu!!

271
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,422
Jean!! Reiner!!
Please don't die!!

272
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,731
Ah...
you guys too...

273
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:02,131
I will attract the Warhammer Titan!!

274
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,337
(Liner)
<Peak... Please hold out somehow...>

275
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,246
Guuuuuu!! Gaaaa!!

276
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,946
Guaaaaaaaa!!

277
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,024
Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!

278
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,024
Guaah!!

279
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,328
Now!! Jean!!
(Jean) Ugh!!

280
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,970
Uuuuuuu!!

281
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,306
Be patient!! Reiner!!・

282
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,606
Until I detonate it...

283
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,744
Damn...!
That's normal, it increases me...!

284
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,120
(Peak) Heeeeeeee!!

285
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,720
I wish I could do three-dimensional maneuvers too...!

286
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,096
Shit, don't come closer... Gah!! Ugh!!

287
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,169
...Peak!! No!! Run away!!

288
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,413
Jean... I'm
not cut out for battle.

289
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,383
I thought it was a giant working on chores ...

290
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,483
It's a mistake!!

291
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,556
(Peak)
As long as I don't get killed, the sustaining power of the car is...

292
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,656
I can fight until I win!!

293
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,364
Even hundreds of times!!

294
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,664
That's why Jean!! Don't worry about me and
detonate!!

295
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,770
Argh!!

296
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,114
Well, even if I win a hundred times...

297
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,585
If there are a million enemies, there's nothing you can do...

298
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,455
Goaaaaaa!!

299
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,457
Gooooo!!

300
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,726
Ha ha ha ha...!

301
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,029
(Ani) Even Bertolt is a puppet...

302
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,532
can not forgive…!

303
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,467
…there was!!

304
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,370
that! A pig or some kind of giant!!

305
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,940
Which/
that! Over there... that!

306
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,410
(Ani)
Where? What are the nine giants?

307
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,115
Is it a Kuruma force? A beast? It might be a jaw!!
(Ani)...I don't know!!

308
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:32,351
Mikasa!! You're being serious!!
You're doing it!!

309
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,855
Ah!! Only one escaped!!

310
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,559
(Ani) That... That's an okapi!!
I don't know about okapi!!

311
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,762
(Ani) Go Falco!!
Chase that okapi or something to the tailbone.

312
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,862
Bring back Armin!!

313
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,272
I can support you with this rifle!

314
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,772
There are no giants here who would die because of it.

315
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,980
(Levi)
<Where is Sieg? Where is he?

316
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,650
Damn... Even if I find it,
it's still this crap.

317
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,750
It's a hindrance... Shit...!!>

318
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,228
<I have never failed to follow his orders
...not even once...

319
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,928
But... why is his last command the only one...>

320
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:28,774
<Our role
may have ended there...

321
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:33,974
If the role was just to deliver the kids to the sea ...>

322
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:43,182
<Hey... Were the hearts you sacrificed meant to crush other hearts? >

323
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,094
<No...

324
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,997
The world without giants that we dreamed of...

325
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:55,835
It must have been a shockingly auspicious
ideal world.・

326
00:23:55,835 --> 00:24:01,440
Otherwise,
it's not worth their hearts.・

327
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,677
Erwin I...

328
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:08,677
I have no regrets about not choosing you.>

329
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,889
< I entrusted my future to that guy who had the same eyes as you ...>

330
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:24,330
・～

331
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,930
Tae!! Connie! I went there!!

332
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,837
Wait, Oi!!

333
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,845
It’s gone!! You can run towards the skull!!

334
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,845
Ani!!

335
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:46,216
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!!

336
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,694
Oh!!

337
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,694
Stop, Okapi!!

338
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,734
Ha...!

339
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,734
Aaah!!

340
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,144
Ugh...!

341
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,880
...

342
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,080
Aaaaaa!!

343
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,456
Uuuuuuu!!

344
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,456
Ani!!

345
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,996
It's no good if you're alone!!
You'll be killed right away!!

346
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,670
For those with super large okapi...!!

347
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,672
Unpalatable…!

348
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,672
…Oi!!

349
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,962
Why...
why isn't my body moving...

350
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,264
Please move!

351
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,800
Everyone will die!

352
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,770
Liner...Peak...

353
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,040
Jean... Connie...

354
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,210
Mikasa... Ani.

355
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,081
Everyone is going to die!!
Wake up, you scum!!

356
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,718
Bastard!! Useless!!

357
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,621
Ugh... huh...

358
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:33,292
I hate myself! Zuuutt you!!

359
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,696
You have been betraying me!!

360
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:40,166
The life I received!! The expectations!! The responsibility too!!

361
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,937
Nothing!! Nothing!!
You couldn't give anything back!!

362
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,274
But!! Why is he dead?

363
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,474
Move!! Move!!

364
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:59,352
Aaaaaaa…!!

365
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,152
Aaaaaaa...!!

366
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:11,897
(People scream)

367
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:55,574
・～

368
00:27:55,574 --> 00:28:24,537
(cry)

369
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:33,179
・～

370
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,114
teeth….

371
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:45,591
・～

372
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,260
<Sand…｡・

373
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,831
Think about it...
if you're really dead...

374
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:56,431
How can you think without oxygen flowing to your brain ? >

375
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:03,705
<This is
not a dream, a vision, or an afterlife.>

376
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,981
<This is the “road”…

377
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,881
This is... reality!!>

378
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:23,796
<I'm supposed to be in the giant's mouth, so
why do I know everyone's situation...? ・

379
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:28,968
Is it because all Eldians
are connected through "roads"? ・

380
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:34,139
Then
maybe we can do something here...>

381
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,576
Yes, think about it...

382
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,576
Think!!

383
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,482
picture….

384
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,624
(Armin's footsteps)

385
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,828
Hello,
Mr. Zeke.

386
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:11,176
Hello,
Ellen's friend.

387
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,076
Were you also
eaten by Ymir?

388
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:30,129
(Jeek) A long time ago...

389
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:35,329
When only matter existed in this world ...

390
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:44,777
(Jeek) Something imaginable and intangible
repeatedly appears and disappears.

391
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:48,877
Eventually, something survived.

392
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,650
It's called "life."

393
00:30:57,256 --> 00:31:00,893
The reason why life remained in the end was...

394
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:05,731
This is because life
has the property of ``multiplying. ''

395
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:10,302
In order to increase, life changes its shape.

396
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:16,108
We have adapted to any environment and
have become what we are today.

397
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,946
More, wider, richer...

398
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:25,884
In other words, the purpose of life is to "increase."

399
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:32,091
This sand, stones, and water
are not going to increase.

400
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:36,929
However, life is still desperately trying to increase.

401
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:42,735
After all, death and species extinction go against the purpose of increasing numbers.

402
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,438
For that reason, there is a penalty called fear.

403
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:52,044
That child
was also desperately trying to escape from that pain...

404
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:56,882
Create a stronger, larger, and immortal body.

405
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,252
And to a world where even death doesn't exist...

406
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,655
She escaped...

407
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:08,460
That's the founder Ymir...
this is the "world where death doesn't exist"...

408
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,233
If that's the case,
what exactly is Ymir's purpose?

409
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,170
I also spend a lot of time here ...

410
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,073
I tried to understand her .

411
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,443
Even though I have this much power ...

412
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,380
I couldn't go against King Fritz
...

413
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,217
Stayed here for 2000 years

414
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:35,117
The reason I continued to follow King Fritz.

415
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,562
I'm sure I left something to be desired,
but...

416
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:49,368
Eren understood that, but
I couldn't...

417
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:54,073
That's why Ymir
joined Eren.

418
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:58,944
Please tell me
how to return to the outside world from here.

419
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,849
Well... I don't think it's possible anymore...

420
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,649
I'm not giving up on anything.

421
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,357
Why...
eh... That's...

422
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,827
Is it because it will still increase?

423
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:20,132
Is it really that important to you to keep the species alive ?

424
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,835
What's happening now...

425
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,805
This can be described as a tragic state of life ruled by fear .

426
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:31,143
brought about by completely meaningless
life activities.

427
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,913
Don't be afraid...
my friends are fighting!!

428
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:39,184
Because now we can still save many people
from fear...!!

429
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,553
I am fighting fear!!

430
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,090
Why can't I lose...?

431
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,827
Being alive means
you'll die someday, right?

432
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,827
Hmm…｡

433
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:58,470
Maybe I'll feel relieved before it's all over ...

434
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,874
I don't even know what it means...

435
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:06,512
After the days of being forced to dance just to increase ...

436
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:09,812
Now I'm free...

437
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,719
ah….

438
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,897
It was dusk, facing a tree on the hill...

439
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,797
The three of us raced...

440
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,471
Eren, who had just
started talking, suddenly started running...

441
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,941
Mikasa dared to run behind Eren...

442
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,243
I'm the dobe after all...

443
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:45,551
But... that day, the wind was warm and
it felt good just running...

444
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:48,587
There were a lot of dry leaves.

445
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:53,292
At that time, for some reason, I thought...

446
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:59,092
I think the three of us were born to play here together ...

447
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,705
Even when I'm reading a book at home on a rainy day...

448
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:10,576
Even when the squirrel ate the fruit I gave it...

449
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:15,347
That's what I thought when we all walked through the market...

450
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,785
I feel like this ordinary moment is so important...

451
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,688
it is…?
Hmm…｡

452
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,591
This one was buried in sand...

453
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,393
Why is that...

454
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,264
Now... But for me, this is...

455
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:36,034
It's not necessary or anything to increase
...

456
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:39,234
It's something very
important.

457
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,843
Ah... that's right.

458
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,746
Just throw it and catch it...

459
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:51,846
Throw it again. Just repeat it.

460
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:01,894
It doesn't make any sense...but it's true...

461
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:06,894
I
was happy just playing catch the whole time.

462
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,568
・

463
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,180
Peek!! Peak!!

464
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,483
Gah...!

465
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,785
If my arm heals,
I can still fight...!

466
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,585
It's the limit!! Back up to the bottom of the liner!

467
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,926
(Peak) is...!!
Liner!!

468
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,861
Oh...! ・

469
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,861
Jean!! Peak!!

470
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,301
Woo!!
Ani!!

471
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,407
Woo... woo...!

472
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,407
Coo...!

473
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,214
...!!

474
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Ha, what...

475
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,528
Ugh... ugh...! ・

476
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,828
Porco!! Marcel!!

477
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,899
・

478
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,705
(Liner) Ymir!!

479
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:23,508
Did you help me...
B...Bertholdt...

480
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:26,211
I don't know...but...

481
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,511
Don't miss this opportunity!!

482
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,420
I got it!!

483
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,029
Armin!!

484
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,629
Give it back!!!

485
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,801
...Gaha!

486
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,607
Armin!!
Damn!!

487
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,007
Oooooooooooooooo!!

488
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,017
Ugh!!

489
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,017
Ani!!

490
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,823
Goho goho geho…｡

491
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:15,093
Kaha… gehogeho… ugh…｡

492
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,996
Annie...

493
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,265
Armin...

494
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,769
Sorry everyone...

495
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,072
But... it's okay now.

496
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,007
(Connie) Ani!! It’s behind you!!

497
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:40,619
・～

498
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,587
・

499
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,457
(Gabi) What do you mean?
A giant is helping you?

500
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,459
It seems so.

501
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,195
(Jeek) Ooi!!

502
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,531
Ooooo!!

503
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:56,201
...!!
Here it is!!

504
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,737
Eh...
that's stupid...

505
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:02,541
You wanted to meet me, right? Levi!!

506
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,510
I didn't want to meet you though!!

507
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,346
...Sieg.

508
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,346
(encourage)

509
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,122
(Connie) What's going on? This is...

510
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:20,459
It's all thanks to Sieg.
Sieg...

511
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:26,331
It awakened everyone who had been sleeping in the world of the road, where there is no life or death .

512
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:30,702
All Eldians
are connected by "roads".

513
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,737
That's probably...

514
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:37,175
This is because Founder Ymir
is seeking a connection.

515
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,778
Asking us something...

516
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,147
...!

517
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,447
Bertolt...

518
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:53,992
Kusava-san,
our wishes didn't come true...

519
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:59,164
I still think that the euthanasia plan was not a mistake...

520
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:03,502
But
if it's just to play catch with you...

521
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,302
I wonder if I can be born again...

522
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,610
that's why…·

523
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,310
I'd like to thank you, Dad.

524
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,719
I
took everything from you.

525
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:26,191
Life, power, and precious memories...

526
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,860
That's why I understand.

527
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,795
I can't stay still here .

528
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,731
everyone….

529
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:35,433
(Zeek Armin) Lend me your strength.

530
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:42,941
・～

531
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,645
Isn't it nice weather...

532
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,948
I wish I had thought of that sooner...

533
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,883
Well...

534
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:56,283
The bugs are too good to kill so many of them
...

535
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,946
The rumbling... has stopped...

536
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,202
Uaaaaaaa!!

537
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,137
Go!! Jean!!

538
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,137
Nu!! Argh!!

539
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,814
(Jean) Uuuuuuu!!
(Peak) Jean!!

540
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Oh!!

541
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,660
this…!!

542
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,498
Hurrying to death... you stupid idiot!!

543
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,734
(explosion sound)

544
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,734
Argh!!

545
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,275
Grrrr…!!!!

546
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,851
This guy!! On Eren’s neck again!!

547
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:41,359
Uuuuuuuuuuuuck!!

548
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,295
Liner!!
(Connie) Jean!! Peak!!・

549
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:46,865
Hurry and leave!!
Armin will blow away every bone!!

550
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,200
Wait!! Liner!!

551
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,539
(Peak) If it's an armored giant,
I'm sure it can withstand a super-sized explosion.

552
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:59,511
Above all, letting this opportunity pass
would mean ruining Reiner's resolve.

553
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,611
Nuaaaaaaaa!!!

554
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,050
thank you….

555
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,990
Without everyone's help...

556
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,490
I couldn't stop the rumbling...

557
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,404
Goodbye...
Eren.

558
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:43,804
(explosion sound)

559
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:55,367
Ugh...
(Gabi's father) Sister!! Are you okay?

560
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:58,770
What on earth...

561
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:02,070
・It was a huge explosion!!
・Did everyone survive?
(Father Falco)! that…!

562
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,980
(Jean) Look at the bones...!!・

563
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,580
Is Eren... dead?

564
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:18,823
Ugh!!
Ackerman awakens to his power...

565
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,760
Apparently , sudden headaches were
common...

566
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,230
I've been a slave who just follows orders...
ever since I was a kid...
<I can't believe that was the last time...>

567
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,634
Mikasa, I hated you.

568
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,734
<That kind of thing...>

569
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,075
Oh!

570
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:39,075
Oh...!!

571
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:50,588
・～

572
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:54,159
(Connie) That doesn't mean I don't have any regrets.・

573
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,094
but…·

574
00:44:56,094 --> 00:45:01,366
We weren't wrong.
We stopped the rumbling...

575
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:05,537
How... from the containment area to here...

576
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:10,141
(Carina) Leonhart-
san led everyone to this point.

577
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,341
Let me go.

578
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,579
…Ha!

579
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,918
Armin!!
Where is Liner?

580
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,298
(Gabi) Reiner!!
(Jan) You're safe!!

581
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,598
Oi!! Look!! Over there!!

582
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:41,272
Are you still alive after that explosion?

583
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,842
Yes... what on earth is that?

584
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,377
Well...just...

585
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:49,377
It certainly shouldn't be kept alive.

586
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,820
(Explosion sound)
(Aluminum liner)!!

587
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,723
(explosion sound)

588
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:01,626
Well... I guess...

589
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,629
I don't think you'll die from that.

590
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,929
Ah...but what should I do?

591
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,234
...Eren.
(Earth rumbling)

592
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:23,648
That's bad!! If Eren comes into contact with the glowing thing,
the ground might start rumbling again...!!

593
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:26,484
(Connie) Oh, I have to kill him!!

594
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:30,088
How do you kill someone who survived that explosion?

595
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,791
The person you should aim for is Eren.

596
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:39,664
You understand...
this nightmare won't end until we kill him...

597
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:43,301
Dad, there's one last job left.

598
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:47,238
I'll do it for you, brother.

599
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,941
…why?

600
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:52,441
Why...
why does this happen?

601
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,816
Hah...

602
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,892
Did you hurt your leg?
Oh!

603
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:11,492
No, it was bad from the beginning...I was saved.

604
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,066
Can you walk?

605
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:18,803
(Leonhart)
If you hadn't shot all the bullets into the air...

606
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:22,240
We
would still be killing each other...

607
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,143
I've made enough mistakes...

608
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:28,479
Let 's work together
to get through this.Ah
...

609
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,415
(Ani) Dad
!!

610
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:33,284
Ha ha ha...

611
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,284
A...Ani?

612
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,028
(Gabi) This smoke is coming from that glowing thing!!

613
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:48,900
Did you die?
No... it smells like a dead giant.

614
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,170
Oh! this is…·

615
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,505
It's the same method as Ragako Village...

616
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,441
Oh!
…picture?

617
00:47:56,441 --> 00:48:00,044
Mikasa!! Peak!! Get on Falco!!
Get out of here!!

618
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,947
What... what are you talking about?

619
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:06,384
Ackerman and those with the power of the Titans
are exceptions.

620
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,888
You should know best what to do !

621
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:15,660
That's... that's too much.

622
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,660
hurry up!!

623
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,466
No!! Dad!! Dad!!

624
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:33,941
Guaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!

625
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,588
Is this our last moment?

626
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,523
Well…｡・

627
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:51,023
I'll leave the rest to my friends,
because that's the end of the Survey Corps.

628
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,400
Do you remember, Jean? ・

629
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,270
About the night I burned the corpse.Ah
...

630
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,508
(Connie) It's all your fault, isn't it? ・

631
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:06,708
We were forced to save humanity...

632
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:17,488
Oh...!!

633
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:23,094
Idiot...
Is there something so... stupid like this?

634
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,364
(Onyankopon) Oi!! Oi!! Ani!!

635
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:29,600
Are you okay? What the hell happened?

636
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
(Roaring)
!!

637
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,305
Hey... Secretary!!
Ah...!!

638
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,143
Ugh...!

639
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,603
This guy...he called for the soldiers...

640
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,572
Just kidding!!

641
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:09,941
Never pass here!!

642
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,876
Wow!! Guooooo!!

643
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:18,049
Damn...! You really
like hell, Eren!!

644
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:23,649
It's okay... I
'll be with you till the end!!!

645
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,493
WOOOOOOOO!!

646
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:38,532
Connie... Jean... Gabi...!!

647
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,904
No way... why, mother...

648
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,543
Uggaaaa!!

649
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,649
(Liner)
Peak!! Ani!!

650
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:55,449
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!

651
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,691
(Liner) We are...

652
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,891
How can I be rewarded?

653
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,331
Daaaa!! Uuuuu!!
(Levi) Mikasa・

654
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:11,702
Stay strong!!
We are the only ones who can kill Eren now!!

655
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,638
Ugh...!!

656
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,941
No more... no more...

657
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,941
Intolerable…!

658
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,945
I want to go home…!

659
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,049
I want to go back to our house...

660
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,960
Mikasa... wake up.

661
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,895
yeah….

662
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,897
I'm going to catch a cold.

663
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,366
Eren...?

664
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:45,303
that? I….

665
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,903
When did you fall asleep...

666
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,176
(Sound of chopping firewood)

667
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:56,247
I must have been really tired...
hmm...

668
00:51:56,247 --> 00:52:01,085
I feel like I was having a long dream...

669
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:05,256
Let's just relax and do nothing today
.

670
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,625
I also managed to catch a big fish...

671
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,595
Mikasa...

672
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,895
Why are you crying?
…picture?

673
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:18,236
Why is that?

674
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:23,136
I... I wonder if it's okay to stay here ...

675
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:28,546
There's nothing I can do anymore...

676
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,481
picture?

677
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:35,981
Since that day when we left everything behind and
ran away here...

678
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,193
Two months have passed since Marley's war ended...

679
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:46,264
The war of invasion of Paradis Island is about to begin...

680
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:49,233
If we don't run, we'll all be killed...

681
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:54,672
Armin
is probably desperately looking for us too.

682
00:52:54,672 --> 00:53:00,878
I have the ability to send Historia to hell and
kill each other for eternity.

683
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:06,083
Nor could they massacre people outside the island
...

684
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:11,789
In that case,
let's live the remaining four years of our lives quietly...

685
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:16,160
Just the two of us in a place where no one is around...

686
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,460
Mikasa, you were the one who said that .

687
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,968
Yeah….

688
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:33,907
I'm sorry...
I promised not to talk about this...

689
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:40,351
Can I make another promise?

690
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:45,156
If I die, please
throw away this muffler...

691
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:50,428
You're going to live a long time from now on...

692
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:54,428
Please forget about me and be free...

693
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,640
Please, Mikasa...

694
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,575
Forget it.

695
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:26,263
・～

696
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,263
sorry.

697
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,501
Can not.

698
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:37,508
Eren is in your mouth!!

699
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,344
Everyone cooperate!!

700
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:43,044
(Levi) Understood, Mikasa!!
(Falco) Oooooooo!!

701
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,949
Ellen!!!

702
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,263
Damn...!!

703
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:01,263
Dah!!

704
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,335
!! Doaaaa!!

705
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,786
Tee!!

706
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:37,886
・～

707
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,154
Take care.

708
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:59,623
Ellen.

709
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:29,823
・～

710
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,929
I know it 's for the sake of the future seen through the power of Attack on Titan,
but...

711
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:44,135
The reason you had to beat me up ...what?

712
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,737
Was it necessary to throw in a knee kick?

713
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,174
Desperate to push you away...

714
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:54,612
Even I was wondering what I was doing
...

715
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:58,315
Leave it to the momentum and flow...

716
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,284
It was really bad...

717
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:03,654
You should tell Mikasa that, not me.

718
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:06,257
You hurt me by saying such bullshit...

719
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:09,557
Ah... that's right.

720
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:14,431
Everything is
about us who were pushed away...

721
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,567
Defeat Eren

722
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:20,437
To make him into a hero who saved humanity from extinction ?

723
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,439
That's it.

724
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:27,077
You will be the benefactors of all surviving humans .

725
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:31,877
Although he was the "Island Devil",
he disobeyed Paradis Island and stuck to humanity.

726
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:37,488
He must become the most respected person in this world .

727
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:41,358
Well then,
like the Tiber family after the Great War...

728
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,058
Are you telling me to protect Paradis Island from the retaliation of humans outside the wall ?

729
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:51,602
There's no way we
can become heroes...

730
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:54,238
It's unfortunate, but me and everyone...

731
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:57,638
I'm not going to play the hero the way you want me to .

732
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,479
where….

733
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,216
That's where we wanted to go.

734
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,685
Let's talk while walking.

735
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,985
The story of the founder Ymir...

736
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:22,366
(Eren Armin) Haa...!

737
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:26,370
This is flaming water...

738
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:30,170
It really flows like a river...

739
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:37,414
How far
did you talk?

740
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:42,987
picture?
Because the founder Ymir has been following King Fritz for 2,000 years ...

741
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:45,956
The power of the Titans still exists...

742
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:51,695
That's right... My hometown was burned down, my parents were killed, and
my tongue was pulled out...

743
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:56,567
Even after gaining power equal to that of God,
he remained obedient...

744
00:58:56,567 --> 00:59:00,804
I wonder what made her do that...

745
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:04,775
I touched her on the "road" and felt...

746
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:07,444
I couldn't believe it, but...

747
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:11,949
The founder Ymir... loved King Fritz.

748
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,884
…picture?

749
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:18,584
This is the true identity of what has continued to bind Ymir even after 2000 years .

750
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:27,965
It is impossible to understand the depths of founder Ymir's heart .

751
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:32,269
But... she was definitely in pain.

752
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:38,375
For 2,000 years,
I've been searching for someone to free me from my suffering...

753
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:41,345
It finally appeared.

754
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:43,545
That's Mikasa.

755
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:49,119
...Eh... I said Mikasa...

756
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,022
I said it. I guess you didn't hear me...

757
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:54,725
I heard you!

758
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:57,628
Why... Mikasa?

759
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:02,466
Well...
only the founder Ymir can understand...

760
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:07,838
I still
don't know what Mikasa will do...

761
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:13,510
What I knew for sure
was the result of Mikasa...

762
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:18,349
I kept going just to reach that result ...

763
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:23,053
Massacre humanity and
make them kill each other on Paradis Island.

764
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:27,024
Everyone... my precious friends...

765
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:31,724
I went into battle without knowing if I would survive .

766
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,568
That's the future I saw at the medal award ceremony...

767
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:40,137
Armin...

768
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,440
My head
is messed up...

769
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,976
The influence of the founder's power is...

770
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,847
There is no past and no future, they exist at the same time...

771
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:53,717
So... I had no choice...

772
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:56,453
That day... that time...

773
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:59,423
Bertholdt
shouldn't have died yet...

774
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,425
…picture?

775
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:04,795
So I missed it...

776
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,895
What led me to...

777
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,967
Let's go, Ellen.

778
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,838
…Ahh.

779
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,714
So... what were you thinking?

780
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:26,617
what?
It's about Mikasa.

781
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:31,255
Do you think you can forget about Eren and
live happily with someone else?

782
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:33,524
As you wish.

783
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,524
Well, I don't know.

784
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:41,098
Good...! Huh… hah…!

785
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:43,333
Ha... ha...｡
...It hurts.

786
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,870
You don't understand,
I don't remember forgiving you!!

787
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,541
What do you think about Mikasa's love for you
?

788
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:54,077
To Mikasa, who has risked her life
to only look at Eren...

789
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,377
Do you think you can just forget about me ?

790
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,886
At least Mikasa
can forget about making this woman cry...

791
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,922
You should be happy!!

792
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:10,022
Well, I feel like I'll be able to find a good person sooner than I expected and get along easily...

793
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:13,597
No...
Huh?

794
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:17,334
I don't want that!! I
can't believe Mikasa has a man!!

795
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,937
I want you to think only of me for the rest of your life!!

796
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,406
Even after I die...

797
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,242
I hope it lasts for more than 10 years!!

798
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,277
Huh… eh…｡

799
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,080
Ah... that's right...

800
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,450
To say something so... uncool...

801
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:38,088
Please don't tell Mikasa about this...

802
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:41,758
I want you to be happy... really...

803
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,827
But… ah…｡

804
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:46,697
Damn it...!

805
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:49,333
I don't want to die...

806
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:54,171
I want to be with Mikasa and everyone...

807
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:57,040
Ellen! Let's search without giving up!!

808
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,276
Isn't there another way...!
No!!

809
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,312
I'm sure everyone , just like me,
didn't want to die...

810
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:05,512
But... I...

811
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:09,985
...!

812
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:19,930
It's 80%
...huh?

813
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:23,230
They trampled 80% of humanity to death...

814
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:30,307
What a...
thing...!!

815
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,210
Eren!! Why!!

816
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:38,148
I am literally
trying to complete the eradication of humanity outside the wall.

817
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,450
You will be blocked.

818
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,120
The result is 80%...

819
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,958
The world outside the wall
will fall to the same level of civilization as Paradis Island.

820
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:52,896
In other words... it probably won't be a unilateral war of retaliation
...

821
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:56,366
This fight will never end.
Huh, hah, hah...

822
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:59,136
What is that...

823
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:02,039
Are you trying to say that what we did was in vain?

824
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,909
That's okay!!
Stop the massacre that hasn't happened yet!!

825
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:11,381
You can't...
you can save up to 20% of humanity.

826
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,284
It's already decided...

827
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,286
Has it been decided...?

828
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:20,390
You decided to kill yourself, right?

829
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:25,729
I've tried so many times and been disappointed, but ...

830
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:31,335
The memories of the future
will remain exactly the same...

831
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,738
Armin... as you said...

832
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:38,342
I am...a free slave.

833
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:40,277
Uh… ugh…!

834
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:43,577
What a stupid thing!!

835
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:48,952
It's already...!! Is there no way to take it back?

836
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:53,624
This is impossible!!
This is not a solution!!

837
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:56,526
There would be no war without people...

838
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,196
Is there anyone who would take such a joke seriously?

839
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,032
Ellen...

840
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:04,935
It's true that this battle has no end in sight...

841
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:11,141
The hell we experienced
was repeated over and over again...I'm sure...

842
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:14,411
Still...someday...

843
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:18,715
I'm sure someday
we'll understand each other...

844
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:22,419
Even a small wish ...

845
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,590
No one believes me anymore...

846
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:32,690
The only lesson left is...
kill or be killed... That's it...

847
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:38,264
Are you saying that you did everything for us ?

848
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,973
(Grisha) "Eren"... That's your name.

849
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:46,743
No, that's not true...

850
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:51,243
Eren... you're free...

851
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,352
I... I wanted it to be flat...

852
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:04,027
I wanted to see this view...

853
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,930
…why?

854
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,167
I don't know why, but...

855
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:13,567
I wanted to do it... I really wanted to...

856
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:21,778
I thought it was all to protect you ...

857
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:26,216
But... Sasha and Hanji both
died because of me.

858
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:29,316
I ended up having them kill each other with Flock and the others
...

859
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:35,192
Why... why did this happen...

860
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:38,095
I finally understood.

861
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,931
It's because you're an idiot.

862
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:45,769
An ordinary idiot who can be found anywhere
has acquired power...

863
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:50,674
That's why I couldn't help but end up like this ...

864
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,374
Isn't that what it means?

865
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,557
I understand...
!

866
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:12,957
I have also had times when I wanted to erase people from this world .

867
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,367
Liar...
that's why you think that...

868
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,436
No one would think so.

869
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:22,606
Because he is a hero who saved 20% of humanity...

870
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:27,444
But... I was the one who showed Ellen the books about the outside world .

871
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:34,217
I was the one who made Eren imagine a free world without anyone .

872
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,153
it is?

873
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:41,091
I guess you finally noticed...
even though it was always there at your feet...

874
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:45,428
Because I'm always looking far away...

875
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,231
Thank you Ellen.

876
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:53,069
You showed me this scenery on the other side of the wall ...

877
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,406
This is what we did.

878
01:07:56,406 --> 01:08:01,812
So... from now on, we'll be together forever...

879
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:04,714
from now? …where?

880
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,751
If only... in hell.

881
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:12,122
I will suffer for the crime of killing 80% of humanity .

882
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,491
Two people.

883
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:24,000
・～

884
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,369
Armin... it's time.

885
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,172
I'll erase the memories I spent here...

886
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:32,042
I'll remember it again when it's all over...

887
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:35,912
Ah... next time we'll kill each other...

888
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:39,282
And the next time we meet...

889
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,284
Ahh….

890
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:45,722
I'll be waiting for you... in hell.

891
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,691
Yeah….

892
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,791
We'll be together forever...

893
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,500
(Ani) Has your injury healed yet?

894
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,900
that…? Annie...?

895
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,638
Yeah...because I had time.

896
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,768
I remembered... this...

897
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,268
...Armin
!

898
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:45,482
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!

899
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:52,088
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!

900
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:55,392
Armin also regained his memory, right?

901
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:59,029
When Ellen came to see us...

902
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,832
Ah... I heard...

903
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:06,436
The result of Mikasa's choices...

904
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:12,609
The power of the Titans
will be erased from this world...

905
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:17,347
I remember... you polite idiot.

906
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:21,618
Eren... you're that guy...

907
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:28,325
Eren says...
Mom said she'll turn back into a human too...

908
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:33,830
He...
told us... to live long...

909
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,099
Are you...?

910
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:40,099
It's an unnecessary burden for you, you
bastard who is in a hurry to die...

911
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,907
yes….

912
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:47,407
I wanted to talk to you too...

913
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:54,384
welcome home.

914
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:57,754
Right now... Dad.

915
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,054
Gabbyiiiiii!!

916
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,230
Hey you guys.

917
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:10,500
Were you watching?

918
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,837
This seems to be the ending.

919
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:17,807
You all gave... your heart...

920
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:46,736
・～

921
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,736
(Connie) Sasha…｡

922
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:55,512
father, mother…!
Ah... Gabi...｡
(Falco) Gabiiii!!

923
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:57,947
Gabbyiiiiii!!

924
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,883
Falco!!

925
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:06,322
・～

926
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,258
mother….

927
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:13,930
I...
it's like I'm not an armored giant anymore...

928
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,800
(Karina)
...Is it true?

929
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,502
That was good...
!

930
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:24,207
I'm sorry for all this time... Reiner...

931
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:28,078
I didn't need anything more .

932
01:12:28,078 --> 01:12:30,278
Oh...!

933
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:37,053
Already... let's go.

934
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:39,456
picture…? where?

935
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:43,293
If I stay here like this, Eren will surely...

936
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:46,096
I can't give him a proper burial.

937
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:48,296
…I agree.

938
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:54,734
Let me sleep in a quiet place...

939
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:06,416
Eren always fell asleep there.

940
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:09,819
Yes, I think it's a good place.

941
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:25,301
・～

942
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:28,638
(Leon Hart) Listen, Secretary Mueller!

943
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:34,244
Eren Jaeger is dead!
Even the power of the giant disappeared from this world...! ・

944
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:37,280
We are just people now!

945
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,280
Can you prove it? Now here.

946
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,059
If it's a blood test...

947
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,362
(Muller) Right here and now!!

948
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:56,166
Please... prove it.・

949
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,266
Is it a human... or a giant...

950
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:08,211
If we still have the power of the Titans,
we will use our strength to resist.

951
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:13,483
However, even now that a gun is pointed at you,
you remain helpless...

952
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:17,353
This is proof that we are human beings.

953
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:19,353
you…?

954
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:25,828
Armin Arlert, Eldian of Paradis Island .

955
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:30,028
He is the one who killed Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan .

956
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:35,371
It was you...

957
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:38,671
The one who was looking inside my head...

958
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:44,914
I think your love was a long nightmare...

959
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:48,518
The lives that were taken will never come back.

960
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:50,486
nevertheless…·

961
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,390
I exist because you created a life for me .

962
01:14:54,390 --> 01:15:03,967
・～

963
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:06,703
Good night, Ymir.

964
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:38,201
・～

965
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:43,339
(Histria) <Three years have passed since that day, which was called the "Battle of Heaven and Earth"
...

966
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:47,210
An incredible number of lives have been taken.

967
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:52,310
Those who survived
may also suffer from scars that never heal.

968
01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:01,858
<As the world in the midst of loss fears,
the country of Eldia...

969
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:05,161
Formed an "army" controlled by the Jaeger faction .

970
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,398
I am getting stronger day by day.・

971
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:12,568
Fearing retribution from the surviving humans on the other side of the ocean ...

972
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,872
The island will come together and raise its voice.・

973
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:20,276
If you win, you live; if you lose, you die.・

974
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:23,046
if you do not fight, you can not win.·

975
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:27,483
Fight, fight.・

976
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:31,788
Even if the giants disappear,
the conflict will not end.・

977
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:35,792
Eren
told me about the future as far as he knew.

978
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:39,529
Even if I can't see any further into the future ...

979
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:43,733
I could clearly see this future .・

980
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:48,571
I'm sure this result
wasn't just Eren's choice.・

981
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:53,242
This world is the result of our choices .

982
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:57,013
We have to fight.・

983
01:16:57,013 --> 01:16:59,716
In order not to fight any more...

984
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:04,620
Even if I have to live my days without peace again .・

985
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,424
It's not the life he wanted for us ...

986
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:13,596
Whether he wanted it or not,
it was entrusted to us.・

987
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:17,767
How to live the remaining grace...>

988
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:20,667
"A world without giants."

989
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:30,713
No matter how many times I look at it, Historia's handwriting is beautiful.

990
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:32,749
It also smells good...

991
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:37,887
(Jan) I've said it many times, but
stop feeling bad about married people. It's disgusting.

992
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:42,392
It seems like Jean is worried about his hair and
can't help it.

993
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:44,360
Who are you going to show it to?

994
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,797
For female students reading history textbooks.

995
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:50,700
Are you confusing this with a picture book about horses?

996
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,603
(Jan)
It's a shame that your lifespan has been extended, Reiner.

997
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:56,803
・(Sound of door opening)
Paradis Island is now in sight.

998
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:02,812
Armin: Do you really think it'll work out?

999
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:06,449
Destroy the wall, betray the island...

1000
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:10,319
The people who killed Eren, who are worshiped by the people of Eldia ...

1001
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,223
Serving as ambassador for the Allied powers in peace negotiations...

1002
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:19,061
I don't think I would be surprised if it was sunk around here
...

1003
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:22,932
Ah... I can't believe the ship is still
floating...

1004
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:28,137
This is the role of the world's hero that that idiot forced upon me .

1005
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:30,673
What do you want to live longer?

1006
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:35,378
What, Annie , did you just board the ship with the intention of returning home alive ?

1007
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,114
No way, but you guys...

1008
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:41,014
You didn't come here to commit suicide,
right?

1009
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:49,592
The answer is that I'm headed to hell again .

1010
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:55,131
The Survey Corps
are dreamers and don't give up easily.

1011
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,066
I'm a military police officer.

1012
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:00,403
For now, I'm not killed yet.

1013
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:04,273
Everyone on Paradis Island
should want to know.

1014
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:06,876
Our story.

1015
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:25,261
・～

1016
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,698
People who killed each other a lot...

1017
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,601
Why did it appear on Paradis Island...

1018
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:34,504
Are you appealing for peace?

1019
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:52,889
・～

1020
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:56,325
The story we saw...

1021
01:19:56,325 --> 01:20:07,336
・～

1022
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:10,273
Let's talk about it all.

1023
01:20:10,273 --> 01:20:17,173
・～

1024
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:31,527
・～

1025
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:35,027
Ellen... everyone will be coming to see you soon.

1026
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:41,470
Are you happy?

1027
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:58,888
・～

1028
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:02,224
Huh… ugh…｡

1029
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:06,629
Uh... huh...｡

1030
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,532
Huh... uh...｡

1031
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:12,632
Huh... huh...｡

1032
01:21:15,805 --> 01:21:19,405
(cry)

1033
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:25,611
I want to see you again….

1034
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,118
(Sound of wings)
!!

1035
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:49,238
・～

1036
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:54,443
Ellen...
Thank you for wrapping the muffler...

1037
01:21:54,443 --> 01:22:26,375
