00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:23,648
That's bad!! If Eren comes into contact with the glowing thing,
the ground might start rumbling again...!!
593
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:26,484
(Connie) Oh, I have to kill him!!
594
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:30,088
How do you kill someone who survived that explosion?
595
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,791
The person you should aim for is Eren.
596
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:39,664
You understand...
this nightmare won't end until we kill him...
597
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:43,301
Dad, there's one last job left.
598
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:47,238
I'll do it for you, brother.
599
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,941
…why?
600
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:52,441
Why...
why does this happen?
601
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,816
Hah...
602
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,892
Did you hurt your leg?
Oh!
603
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:11,492
No, it was bad from the beginning...I was saved.
604
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,066
Can you walk?
605
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:18,803
(Leonhart)
If you hadn't shot all the bullets into the air...
606
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:22,240
We
would still be killing each other...
607
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,143
I've made enough mistakes...
608
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:28,479
Let 's work together
to get through this.Ah
...
609
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,415
(Ani) Dad
!!
610
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:33,284
Ha ha ha...
611
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,284
A...Ani?
612
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,028
(Gabi) This smoke is coming from that glowing thing!!
613
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:48,900
Did you die?
No... it smells like a dead giant.
614
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,170
Oh! this is…·
615
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,505
It's the same method as Ragako Village...
616
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,441
Oh!
…picture?
617
00:47:56,441 --> 00:48:00,044
Mikasa!! Peak!! Get on Falco!!
Get out of here!!
618
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,947
What... what are you talking about?
619
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:06,384
Ackerman and those with the power of the Titans
are exceptions.
620
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,888
You should know best what to do !
621
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:15,660
That's... that's too much.
622
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,660
hurry up!!
623
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,466
No!! Dad!! Dad!!
624
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:33,941
Guaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!
625
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,588
Is this our last moment?
626
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,523
Well…｡・
627
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:51,023
I'll leave the rest to my friends,
because that's the end of the Survey Corps.
628
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,400
Do you remember, Jean? ・
629
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,270
About the night I burned the corpse.Ah
...
630
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,508
(Connie) It's all your fault, isn't it? ・
631
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:06,708
We were forced to save humanity...
632
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:17,488
Oh...!!
633
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:23,094
Idiot...
Is there something so... stupid like this?
634
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,364
(Onyankopon) Oi!! Oi!! Ani!!
635
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:29,600
Are you okay? What the hell happened?
636
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
(Roaring)
!!
637
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,305
Hey... Secretary!!
Ah...!!
638
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,143
Ugh...!
639
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,603
This guy...he called for the soldiers...
640
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,572
Just kidding!!
641
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:09,941
Never pass here!!
642
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,876
Wow!! Guooooo!!
643
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:18,049
Damn...! You really
like hell, Eren!!
644
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:23,649
It's okay... I
'll be with you till the end!!!
645
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,493
WOOOOOOOO!!
646
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:38,532
Connie... Jean... Gabi...!!
647
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,904
No way... why, mother...
648
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,543
Uggaaaa!!
649
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,649
(Liner)
Peak!! Ani!!
650
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:55,449
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!
651
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,691
(Liner) We are...
652
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,891
How can I be rewarded?
653
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,331
Daaaa!! Uuuuu!!
(Levi) Mikasa・
654
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:11,702
Stay strong!!
We are the only ones who can kill Eren now!!
655
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,638
Ugh...!!
656
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,941
No more... no more...
657
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,941
Intolerable…!
658
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,945
I want to go home…!
659
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,049
I want to go back to our house...
660
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,960
Mikasa... wake up.
661
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,895
yeah….
662
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,897
I'm going to catch a cold.
663
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,366
Eren...?
664
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:45,303
that? I….
665
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,903
When did you fall asleep...
666
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,176
(Sound of chopping firewood)
667
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:56,247
I must have been really tired...
hmm...
668
00:51:56,247 --> 00:52:01,085
I feel like I was having a long dream...
669
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:05,256
Let's just relax and do nothing today
.
670
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,625
I also managed to catch a big fish...
671
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,595
Mikasa...
672
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,895
Why are you crying?
…picture?
673
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:18,236
Why is that?
674
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:23,136
I... I wonder if it's okay to stay here ...
675
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:28,546
There's nothing I can do anymore...
676
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,481
picture?
677
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:35,981
Since that day when we left everything behind and
ran away here...
678
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,193
Two months have passed since Marley's war ended...
679
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:46,264
The war of invasion of Paradis Island is about to begin...
680
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:49,233
If we don't run, we'll all be killed...
681
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:54,672
Armin
is probably desperately looking for us too.
682
00:52:54,672 --> 00:53:00,878
I have the ability to send Historia to hell and
kill each other for eternity.
683
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:06,083
Nor could they massacre people outside the island
...
684
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:11,789
In that case,
let's live the remaining four years of our lives quietly...
685
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:16,160
Just the two of us in a place where no one is around...
686
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,460
Mikasa, you were the one who said that .
687
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,968
Yeah….
688
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:33,907
I'm sorry...
I promised not to talk about this...
689
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:40,351
Can I make another promise?
690
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:45,156
If I die, please
throw away this muffler...
691
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:50,428
You're going to live a long time from now on...
692
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:54,428
Please forget about me and be free...
693
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,640
Please, Mikasa...
694
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,575
Forget it.
695
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:26,263
・～
696
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,263
sorry.
697
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,501
Can not.
698
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:37,508
Eren is in your mouth!!
699
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,344
Everyone cooperate!!
700
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:43,044
(Levi) Understood, Mikasa!!
(Falco) Oooooooo!!
701
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,949
Ellen!!!
702
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,263
Damn...!!
703
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:01,263
Dah!!
704
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,335
!! Doaaaa!!
705
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,786
Tee!!
706
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:37,886
・～
707
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,154
Take care.
708
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:59,623
Ellen.
709
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:29,823
・～
710
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,929
I know it 's for the sake of the future seen through the power of Attack on Titan,
but...
711
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:44,135
The reason you had to beat me up ...what?
712
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:46,737
Was it necessary to throw in a knee kick?
713
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,174
Desperate to push you away...
714
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:54,612
Even I was wondering what I was doing
...
715
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:58,315
Leave it to the momentum and flow...
716
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,284
It was really bad...
717
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:03,654
You should tell Mikasa that, not me.
718
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:06,257
You hurt me by saying such bullshit...
719
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:09,557
Ah... that's right.
720
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:14,431
Everything is
about us who were pushed away...
721
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,567
Defeat Eren
722
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:20,437
To make him into a hero who saved humanity from extinction ?
723
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,439
That's it.
724
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:27,077
You will be the benefactors of all surviving humans .
725
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:31,877
Although he was the "Island Devil",
he disobeyed Paradis Island and stuck to humanity.
726
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:37,488
He must become the most respected person in this world .
727
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:41,358
Well then,
like the Tiber family after the Great War...
728
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,058
Are you telling me to protect Paradis Island from the retaliation of humans outside the wall ?
729
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:51,602
There's no way we
can become heroes...
730
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:54,238
It's unfortunate, but me and everyone...
731
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:57,638
I'm not going to play the hero the way you want me to .
732
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,479
where….
733
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,216
That's where we wanted to go.
734
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,685
Let's talk while walking.
735
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,985
The story of the founder Ymir...
736
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:22,366
(Eren Armin) Haa...!
737
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:26,370
This is flaming water...
738
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:30,170
It really flows like a river...
739
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:37,414
How far
did you talk?
740
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:42,987
picture?
Because the founder Ymir has been following King Fritz for 2,000 years ...
741
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:45,956
The power of the Titans still exists...
742
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:51,695
That's right... My hometown was burned down, my parents were killed, and
my tongue was pulled out...
743
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:56,567
Even after gaining power equal to that of God,
he remained obedient...
744
00:58:56,567 --> 00:59:00,804
I wonder what made her do that...
745
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:04,775
I touched her on the "road" and felt...
746
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:07,444
I couldn't believe it, but...
747
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:11,949
The founder Ymir... loved King Fritz.
748
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,884
…picture?
749
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:18,584
This is the true identity of what has continued to bind Ymir even after 2000 years .
750
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:27,965
It is impossible to understand the depths of founder Ymir's heart .
751
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:32,269
But... she was definitely in pain.
752
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:38,375
For 2,000 years,
I've been searching for someone to free me from my suffering...
753
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:41,345
It finally appeared.
754
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:43,545
That's Mikasa.
755
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:49,119
...Eh... I said Mikasa...
756
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,022
I said it. I guess you didn't hear me...
757
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:54,725
I heard you!
758
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:57,628
Why... Mikasa?
759
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:02,466
Well...
only the founder Ymir can understand...
760
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:07,838
I still
don't know what Mikasa will do...
761
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:13,510
What I knew for sure
was the result of Mikasa...
762
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:18,349
I kept going just to reach that result ...
763
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:23,053
Massacre humanity and
make them kill each other on Paradis Island.
764
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:27,024
Everyone... my precious friends...
765
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:31,724
I went into battle without knowing if I would survive .
766
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,568
That's the future I saw at the medal award ceremony...
767
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:40,137
Armin...
768
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,440
My head
is messed up...
769
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,976
The influence of the founder's power is...
770
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,847
There is no past and no future, they exist at the same time...
771
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:53,717
So... I had no choice...
772
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:56,453
That day... that time...
773
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:59,423
Bertholdt
shouldn't have died yet...
774
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,425
…picture?
775
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:04,795
So I missed it...
776
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,895
What led me to...
777
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,967
Let's go, Ellen.
778
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,838
…Ahh.
779
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,714
So... what were you thinking?
780
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:26,617
what?
It's about Mikasa.
781
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:31,255
Do you think you can forget about Eren and
live happily with someone else?
782
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:33,524
As you wish.
783
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,524
Well, I don't know.
784
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:41,098
Good...! Huh… hah…!
785
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:43,333
Ha... ha...｡
...It hurts.
786
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,870
You don't understand,
I don't remember forgiving you!!
787
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,541
What do you think about Mikasa's love for you
?
788
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:54,077
To Mikasa, who has risked her life
to only look at Eren...
789
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:57,377
Do you think you can just forget about me ?
790
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,886
At least Mikasa
can forget about making this woman cry...
791
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,922
You should be happy!!
792
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:10,022
Well, I feel like I'll be able to find a good person sooner than I expected and get along easily...
793
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:13,597
No...
Huh?
794
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:17,334
I don't want that!! I
can't believe Mikasa has a man!!
795
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,937
I want you to think only of me for the rest of your life!!
796
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,406
Even after I die...
797
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,242
I hope it lasts for more than 10 years!!
798
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,277
Huh… eh…｡
799
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,080
Ah... that's right...
800
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,450
To say something so... uncool...
801
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:38,088
Please don't tell Mikasa about this...
802
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:41,758
I want you to be happy... really...
803
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,827
But… ah…｡
804
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:46,697
Damn it...!
805
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:49,333
I don't want to die...
806
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:54,171
I want to be with Mikasa and everyone...
807
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:57,040
Ellen! Let's search without giving up!!
808
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,276
Isn't there another way...!
No!!
809
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,312
I'm sure everyone , just like me,
didn't want to die...
810
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:05,512
But... I...
811
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:09,985
...!
812
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:19,930
It's 80%
...huh?
813
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:23,230
They trampled 80% of humanity to death...
814
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:30,307
What a...
thing...!!
815
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,210
Eren!! Why!!
816
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:38,148
I am literally
trying to complete the eradication of humanity outside the wall.
817
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,450
You will be blocked.
818
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,120
The result is 80%...
819
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,958
The world outside the wall
will fall to the same level of civilization as Paradis Island.
820
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:52,896
In other words... it probably won't be a unilateral war of retaliation
...
821
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:56,366
This fight will never end.
Huh, hah, hah...
822
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:59,136
What is that...
823
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:02,039
Are you trying to say that what we did was in vain?
824
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,909
That's okay!!
Stop the massacre that hasn't happened yet!!
825
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:11,381
You can't...
you can save up to 20% of humanity.
826
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,284
It's already decided...
827
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,286
Has it been decided...?
828
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:20,390
You decided to kill yourself, right?
829
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:25,729
I've tried so many times and been disappointed, but ...
830
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:31,335
The memories of the future
will remain exactly the same...
831
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,738
Armin... as you said...
832
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:38,342
I am...a free slave.
833
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:40,277
Uh… ugh…!
834
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:43,577
What a stupid thing!!
835
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:48,952
It's already...!! Is there no way to take it back?
836
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:53,624
This is impossible!!
This is not a solution!!
837
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:56,526
There would be no war without people...
838
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,196
Is there anyone who would take such a joke seriously?
839
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,032
Ellen...
840
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:04,935
It's true that this battle has no end in sight...
841
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:11,141
The hell we experienced
was repeated over and over again...I'm sure...
842
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:14,411
Still...someday...
843
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:18,715
I'm sure someday
we'll understand each other...
844
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:22,419
Even a small wish ...
845
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,590
No one believes me anymore...
846
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:32,690
The only lesson left is...
kill or be killed... That's it...
847
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:38,264
Are you saying that you did everything for us ?
848
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,973
(Grisha) "Eren"... That's your name.
849
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:46,743
No, that's not true...
850
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:51,243
Eren... you're free...
851
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,352
I... I wanted it to be flat...
852
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:04,027
I wanted to see this view...
853
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,930
…why?
854
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,167
I don't know why, but...
855
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:13,567
I wanted to do it... I really wanted to...
856
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:21,778
I thought it was all to protect you ...
857
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:26,216
But... Sasha and Hanji both
died because of me.
858
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:29,316
I ended up having them kill each other with Flock and the others
...
859
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:35,192
Why... why did this happen...
860
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:38,095
I finally understood.
861
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,931
It's because you're an idiot.
862
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:45,769
An ordinary idiot who can be found anywhere
has acquired power...
863
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:50,674
That's why I couldn't help but end up like this ...
864
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,374
Isn't that what it means?
865
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,557
I understand...
!
866
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:12,957
I have also had times when I wanted to erase people from this world .
867
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,367
Liar...
that's why you think that...
868
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,436
No one would think so.
869
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:22,606
Because he is a hero who saved 20% of humanity...
870
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:27,444
But... I was the one who showed Ellen the books about the outside world .
871
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:34,217
I was the one who made Eren imagine a free world without anyone .
872
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,153
it is?
873
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:41,091
I guess you finally noticed...
even though it was always there at your feet...
874
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:45,428
Because I'm always looking far away...
875
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,231
Thank you Ellen.
876
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:53,069
You showed me this scenery on the other side of the wall ...
877
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,406
This is what we did.
878
01:07:56,406 --> 01:08:01,812
So... from now on, we'll be together forever...
879
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:04,714
from now? …where?
880
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,751
If only... in hell.
881
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:12,122
I will suffer for the crime of killing 80% of humanity .
882
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,491
Two people.
883
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:24,000
・～
884
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,369
Armin... it's time.
885
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,172
I'll erase the memories I spent here...
886
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:32,042
I'll remember it again when it's all over...
887
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:35,912
Ah... next time we'll kill each other...
888
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:39,282
And the next time we meet...
889
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,284
Ahh….
890
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:45,722
I'll be waiting for you... in hell.
891
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,691
Yeah….
892
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,791
We'll be together forever...
893
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,500
(Ani) Has your injury healed yet?
894
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,900
that…? Annie...?
895
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,638
Yeah...because I had time.
896
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,768
I remembered... this...
897
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,268
...Armin
!
898
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:45,482
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!
899
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:52,088
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!
900
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:55,392
Armin also regained his memory, right?
901
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:59,029
When Ellen came to see us...
902
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,832
Ah... I heard...
903
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:06,436
The result of Mikasa's choices...
904
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:12,609
The power of the Titans
will be erased from this world...
905
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:17,347
I remember... you polite idiot.
906
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:21,618
Eren... you're that guy...
907
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:28,325
Eren says...
Mom said she'll turn back into a human too...
908
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:33,830
He...
told us... to live long...
909
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,099
Are you...?
910
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:40,099
It's an unnecessary burden for you, you
bastard who is in a hurry to die...
911
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,907
yes….
912
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:47,407
I wanted to talk to you too...
913
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:54,384
welcome home.
914
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:57,754
Right now... Dad.
915
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,054
Gabbyiiiiii!!
916
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,230
Hey you guys.
917
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:10,500
Were you watching?
918
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,837
This seems to be the ending.
919
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:17,807
You all gave... your heart...
920
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:46,736
・～
921
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,736
(Connie) Sasha…｡
922
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:55,512
father, mother…!
Ah... Gabi...｡
(Falco) Gabiiii!!
923
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:57,947
Gabbyiiiiii!!
924
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,883
Falco!!
925
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:06,322
・～
926
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,258
mother….
927
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:13,930
I...
it's like I'm not an armored giant anymore...
928
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,800
(Karina)
...Is it true?
929
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,502
That was good...
!
930
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:24,207
I'm sorry for all this time... Reiner...
931
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:28,078
I didn't need anything more .
932
01:12:28,078 --> 01:12:30,278
Oh...!
933
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:37,053
Already... let's go.
934
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:39,456
picture…? where?
935
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:43,293
If I stay here like this, Eren will surely...
936
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:46,096
I can't give him a proper burial.
937
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:48,296
…I agree.
938
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:54,734
Let me sleep in a quiet place...
939
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:06,416
Eren always fell asleep there.
940
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:09,819
Yes, I think it's a good place.
941
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:25,301
・～
942
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:28,638
(Leon Hart) Listen, Secretary Mueller!
943
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:34,244
Eren Jaeger is dead!
Even the power of the giant disappeared from this world...! ・
944
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:37,280
We are just people now!
945
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,280
Can you prove it? Now here.
946
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,059
If it's a blood test...
947
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,362
(Muller) Right here and now!!
948
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:56,166
Please... prove it.・
949
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,266
Is it a human... or a giant...
950
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:08,211
If we still have the power of the Titans,
we will use our strength to resist.
951
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:13,483
However, even now that a gun is pointed at you,
you remain helpless...
952
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:17,353
This is proof that we are human beings.
953
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:19,353
you…?
954
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:25,828
Armin Arlert, Eldian of Paradis Island .
955
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:30,028
He is the one who killed Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan .
956
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:35,371
It was you...
957
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:38,671
The one who was looking inside my head...
958
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:44,914
I think your love was a long nightmare...
959
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:48,518
The lives that were taken will never come back.
960
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:50,486
nevertheless…·
961
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,390
I exist because you created a life for me .
962
01:14:54,390 --> 01:15:03,967
・～
963
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:06,703
Good night, Ymir.
964
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:38,201
・～
965
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:43,339
(Histria) <Three years have passed since that day, which was called the "Battle of Heaven and Earth"
...
966
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:47,210
An incredible number of lives have been taken.
967
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:52,310
Those who survived
may also suffer from scars that never heal.
968
01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:01,858
<As the world in the midst of loss fears,
the country of Eldia...
969
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:05,161
Formed an "army" controlled by the Jaeger faction .
970
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,398
I am getting stronger day by day.・
971
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:12,568
Fearing retribution from the surviving humans on the other side of the ocean ...
972
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,872
The island will come together and raise its voice.・
973
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:20,276
If you win, you live; if you lose, you die.・
974
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:23,046
if you do not fight, you can not win.·
975
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:27,483
Fight, fight.・
976
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:31,788
Even if the giants disappear,
the conflict will not end.・
977
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:35,792
Eren
told me about the future as far as he knew.
978
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:39,529
Even if I can't see any further into the future ...
979
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:43,733
I could clearly see this future .・
980
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:48,571
I'm sure this result
wasn't just Eren's choice.・
981
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:53,242
This world is the result of our choices .
982
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:57,013
We have to fight.・
983
01:16:57,013 --> 01:16:59,716
In order not to fight any more...
984
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:04,620
Even if I have to live my days without peace again .・
985
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,424
It's not the life he wanted for us ...
986
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:13,596
Whether he wanted it or not,
it was entrusted to us.・
987
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:17,767
How to live the remaining grace...>
988
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:20,667
"A world without giants."
989
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:30,713
No matter how many times I look at it, Historia's handwriting is beautiful.
990
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:32,749
It also smells good...
991
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:37,887
(Jan) I've said it many times, but
stop feeling bad about married people. It's disgusting.
992
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:42,392
It seems like Jean is worried about his hair and
can't help it.
993
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:44,360
Who are you going to show it to?
994
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,797
For female students reading history textbooks.
995
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:50,700
Are you confusing this with a picture book about horses?
996
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,603
(Jan)
It's a shame that your lifespan has been extended, Reiner.
997
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:56,803
・(Sound of door opening)
Paradis Island is now in sight.
998
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:02,812
Armin: Do you really think it'll work out?
999
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:06,449
Destroy the wall, betray the island...
1000
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:10,319
The people who killed Eren, who are worshiped by the people of Eldia ...
1001
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,223
Serving as ambassador for the Allied powers in peace negotiations...
1002
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:19,061
I don't think I would be surprised if it was sunk around here
...
1003
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:22,932
Ah... I can't believe the ship is still
floating...
1004
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:28,137
This is the role of the world's hero that that idiot forced upon me .
1005
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:30,673
What do you want to live longer?
1006
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:35,378
What, Annie , did you just board the ship with the intention of returning home alive ?
1007
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,114
No way, but you guys...
1008
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:41,014
You didn't come here to commit suicide,
right?
1009
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:49,592
The answer is that I'm headed to hell again .
1010
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:55,131
The Survey Corps
are dreamers and don't give up easily.
1011
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,066
I'm a military police officer.
1012
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:00,403
For now, I'm not killed yet.
1013
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:04,273
Everyone on Paradis Island
should want to know.
1014
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:06,876
Our story.

1016

People who killed each other a lot...
1017
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,601
Why did it appear on Paradis Island...
1018
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:34,504
Are you appealing for peace?
1019
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:52,889
・～
1020
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:56,325

・～
1022
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:10,273

1033
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:25,611
