Python script to change file name from [.jfif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format) to [.jpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG).\
Alternatively, you can use it to change files from one format to other also.

Keep the python script in same folder where the files to be changed are.

Keeping that [.bat](./changeExtension.bat) file is optional.
