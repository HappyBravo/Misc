# Tried to make a random number generator 
_(by testing it to get the desired result)_
---

## Desired Result : 
```
"The professor then explained that in truly random sequences of 1000 coin tosses,
one would expect to see roughly 60 instances of four consecutive heads and 
around 7 instances of eight consecutive heads or runs."
```
So, 

> in 1000 coin toss:
> - four consecutive 1s = 60
> - eight consecutive 1s = 7
